ConfigMaps:
Configure ConfigMaps in Applications
In this section, we will take a look at configuring configmaps in applications
ConfigMaps are used to pass configuration data in the form of key value pairs in kuberntes. When a pod is created,
inject the
ConfigMaps into the pod so the key value pairs that are available as environmental variables for the application hosted
inside
the container in the pod.
There are 2 phases involved in configuring ConfigMaps.
First, create the configMaps
Second, Inject them into the pod.
Just like any other kubernetes objects there are 2 ways of creating a configmap.
The Imperative way without using a configmap definition file, and the declarative way by by using a configmap definition
file.
If you do not wish to create a configmap definition file, use the command below.
$ kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_COLOR=blue --from-literal=APP_MODE=prod :
The command is followed by the config name and the option from-literal.
the from literal option is used to specify the key value pairs in the command itself.
In this example we are creating a configmap by the value app-onfig, with key value pair APP_COLOR equals blue.
If you wish to add key value pairs simply specify the from literal options multile times however this will get
complicated
when you have too many configuration items.

Another way to input configuration data is through a file. Use the from file option to specify a path to the file that
contains
the required data.
$ kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=app_config.properties (Another way):
The data from this file is read and stored under the name of the file.

The declarative way:
For this, we create a definition file just like how we did for the pod. The file has an API version, kind, metadata, and
instead of spec, here we have data
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: app-config
namespace: prod
data:
APP_COLOR: blue
APP_MODE: prod

Create a config map definition file and run the 'kubectl create` command to deploy it.
$ kubectl create -f config-map.yaml

To view configMaps

$ kubectl get configmaps (or)
$ kubectl get cm
To describe configmaps

$ kubectl describe configmaps
note:
It is important to name your configmaps appropriately as you will be using these names later while associating it with
pods.

Configuring config with pods:
If you have a simple pod definition file that runs a simple web application, to inject an environment variable add a new
property to the container called envFrom.
The envFrom is a list so we can pass as many environmental variables as required. Each item in the list corresponds to
a configmap item. specify the name of the configMaps created earlier. This is how to inject a specific configMaps from
the
ones created before.

Inject configmap in pod

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: simple-webapp-color
namespace: prod
spec:
containers:
- name: simple-webapp-color
image: nginx
ports:
- containerPort: 80
envFrom:
- configMapRef:
name: app-config
$ kubectl create -f pod-definition.yaml


apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: app-config
data:
APP_COLOR: blue
APP_MODE: prod

-You can inject it as a Single Environment Variable
-You can inject it as a file in a Volume

Secrets:
In this section, we will take a look at secrets in kubernetes
Secrets are used to store sensitive information like password or keys.
They are similar to configMaps except that they are stored in an encoded or hashed format. As with config maps there are
2 steps
involved in working with secrets.
First, Create a secret
Second, Inject the secret into a pod.
The Declarative way
For this we create a definition file just like how we did for the configmap
How ever one thing we discussed with secret is that they are used to store sensitive data and are stored in an encoded
format
While creating a secret with the declarative approach you must specify the secret values in a hashed format.
How do you convert the data from plain text to an encoded format: ?
On a linux host from the command,
Generate a hash value of the password and pass it to secret-data.yaml definition value as a value to DB_Password
variable.
$ echo -n "mysql" | base64
$ echo -n "root" | base64
$ echo -n "paswrd"| base64
Create a secret definition file and run kubectl create to deploy it

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
name: app-secret
namespace: prod
data:
DB_Host: bX1zcWw=
DB_User: cm9vdA==
DB_Password: cGFzd3Jk
$ kubectl create -f secret-data.yaml

To view secrets

$ kubectl get secrets
To describe secret

$ kubectl describe secret
To view the values of the secret

$ kubectl get secret app-secret -o yaml
To decode secrets:
$ echo -n "bX1zcWw=" | base64 --decode
$ echo -n "cm9vdA==" | base64 --decode
$ echo -n "cGFzd3Jk" | base64 --decode


Injecting secrets to a pod:
To inject an environmental variable add a new property to the container called envFrom.
The envFrom from property is a list so we can pass as many environmental variables as required. Each item in the list
corresponds
to a secret item.
Specify the name of the secret you created earlier .
Creating the pod definition file now make the data in the secret available as environmental variables for the
application.


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: simple-webapp-color
namespace: prod
spec:
containers:
- name: simple-webapp-color
image: simple-webapp-color
ports:
- containerPort: 8080
envFrom:
- secretRef:
name: app-secret
$ kubectl create -f pod-definition.yaml

note: CreateContainerConfigError
This error indicates that the pod can not reach the secret usually, This is because the pod and secret are on different
namespaces

There are other ways to inject secrets into pods.
You can inject as Single ENV variable

You can inject as whole secret as files in a Volume



StatefulSet:
Overview:

StatefulSets represent a set of Pods with unique, persistent identities and stable hostnames that
GKE maintains regardless of where they are scheduled. The state information and other resilient
data for any given StatefulSet Pod is maintained in persistent disk storage associated with the
StatefulSet.

StatefulSets use an ordinal index for the identity and ordering of their Pods. By default,
StatefulSet Pods are deployed in sequential order and are terminated in reverse ordinal order. For
example, a StatefulSet named web has its Pods named web-0, web-1, and web-2. When the web Pod
specification is changed, its Pods are gracefully stopped and recreated in an ordered way; in this
example, web-2 is terminated first, then web-1, and so on. Alternatively, you can specify the
podManagementPolicy: Parallel field to have a StatefulSet launch or terminate all of its Pods in
parallel, rather than waiting for Pods to become Running and Ready or to be terminated prior to
launching or terminating another Pod.

StatefulSets use a Pod template, which contains a specification for its Pods. The Pod specification
determines how each Pod should look: what applications should run inside its containers, which
volumes it should mount, its labels and selectors, and more.

Usage patterns: StatefulSets are designed to deploy stateful applications and clustered applications
that save data to persistent storage, such as Compute Engine persistent disks. StatefulSets are
suitable for deploying Kafka, MySQL, Redis, ZooKeeper, and other applications needing unique,
persistent identities and stable hostnames. For stateless applications, use Deployments.

Creating StatefulSets: Once created, the StatefulSet ensures that the desired number of Pods are
running and available at all times. The StatefulSet automatically replaces Pods that fail or are
evicted from their nodes, and automatically associates new Pods with the storage resources,
resource requests and limits, and other configurations defined in the StatefulSet's Pod
specification.

The following is an example of a Service and StatefulSet manifest file:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: nginx
labels:
app: nginx
spec:
ports:
- port: 80
name: web
clusterIP: None
selector:
app: nginx
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
name: web
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nginx # Label selector that determines which Pods belong to the StatefulSet
# Must match spec: template: metadata: labels
serviceName: "nginx"
replicas: 3
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: nginx # Pod template's label selector
spec:
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
containers:
- name: nginx
image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
ports:
- containerPort: 80
name: web
volumeMounts:
- name: www
mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
volumeClaimTemplates:
- metadata:
name: www
spec:
accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
resources:
requests:
storage: 1Gi


In this example:

A Service object named nginx is created, indicated by the metadata: name field. The Service targets an app
called nginx, indicated by labels: app: nginx and selector: app: nginx. The Service exposes port 80 and
names it web. This Service controls the network domain and to route Internet traffic to the containerized
application deployed by the StatefulSet.
A StatefulSet named web is created with three replicated Pods (replicas: 3).
The Pod template (spec: template) indicates that its Pods are labelled app: nginx.
The Pod specification (template: spec) indicates that the StatefulSet's Pods run one container, nginx, which
runs the nginx-slim image at version 0.8. The container image is hosted by Container Registry.
The Pod specification uses the web port opened by the Service.
template: spec: volumeMounts specifies a mountPath, which is named www. The mountPath is the path
within the container at which a storage volume should be mounted.
The StatefulSet provisions a PersistentVolumeClaim, www, with 1GB of provisioned storage.

In sum, the Pod specification contains the following instructions:
Label each Pod as app: nginx.
In each Pod, run one container named nginx.
Run the nginx-slim image at version 0.8.
Have Pods use port 80.
Save data to the mount path.
