A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster,
Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected.
Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

running a cluster storage daemon on every node
running a logs collection daemon on every node
running a node monitoring daemon on every node
In a simple case, one DaemonSet, covering all nodes, would be used for each type of daemon. A more
complex setup might use multiple DaemonSets for a single type of daemon, but with different flags
and/or different memory and cpu requests for different hardware types.


Writing a DaemonSet Spec
Create a DaemonSet
You can describe a DaemonSet in a YAML file. For example, the daemonset.yaml file below describes a
DaemonSet that runs the fluentd-elasticsearch Docker image

For DaemonSets, we start with apiVersion, kind as DaemonSets instead of ReplicaSet, metadata and spec.

=============================
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Replicaset
metadata:
name: monitoring-daemon
labels:
app: nginx
spec:
selector:
matchLabels:
app: monitoring-agent
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: monitoring-agent
spec:
containers:
- name: monitoring-agent
image: monitoring-agent

apiVersion: apps/v1
