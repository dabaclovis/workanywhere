let start by assuming you have two servers 
- ServerA
- ServerB 

configuration for ServerA 
==========================
#enable ssh 
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

look for this line 

PasswordAuthentication no 

change no to yes 

save and exit 

run 
service ssh restart 

we are done with serverA 

now ServerB 
====================

run whoami, for my case i am using ubuntu 
make a password for ubuntu with 

$ sudo passwd username

enter your password 

repeat the same password 

next, 
#enable ssh 
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

look for this line

PasswordAuthentication no

change no to yes

save and exit

run
service ssh restart

=====================
GO BACK to ServerA 

#generate ssh-key 

$ssh-keygen 
keep hitting enter till the end  

Copy the ssh to ServerB 

$ssh-copy-id username@private_ip of serverB  
you will type yes for the first prompt and you will be asked to enter the password created in ServerB 

then you are done  

mkdir a directory in ServerA  for example 
mkdir school 
cd school 
touch index.html  
cd ~

now let's move the whole folder to ServerB 
$scp -r ~/school username@private_ip of ServerB:/home/user/

this is my 

scp -r /home/ubuntu/school/ ubuntu@192.168.10.253:/home/ubuntu/
